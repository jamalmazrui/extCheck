# extCheck 2.1.0

extCheck checks Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Markdown files for accessibility problems and writes a report for each. Get it from the [extCheck releases page](https://github.com/JamalMazrui/extCheck/releases).

## What is new in 2.1.0

- **Update from inside the program.** Press F11 in the dialog to check GitHub for a newer version. If there is one, Enter downloads and starts its installer.
- **A log of every session.** Each run keeps its own log in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\extCheck\logs`, so a problem can be explained afterwards even when Log session was off.
- **Settings in the Homer place.** Use configuration now saves to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\extCheck\configs\extCheck.inix`. Settings from earlier versions are carried over.
- **A tidier installation.** The program is in the `exec` folder and the documents and rule registry in `help`, as in every Homer Tools program. The installer's results box comes before extCheck starts.

The full list of changes is in History.

## About the companion accessibility tools

`urlCheck`, `extCheck`, and `2htm` are a small family of free, MIT-licensed Windows command-line tools written by Jamal Mazrui and shared on GitHub. Each is distributed as a single-file, independent binary executable that runs without an installation step, without a runtime dependency, and without anything in the registry.

- [`urlCheck`](https://github.com/JamalMazrui/urlCheck) — drives Microsoft Edge through Playwright and runs axe-core on each page, producing per-page reports plus a session-level Accessibility Conformance Report (`ACR.xlsx` and `ACR.docx`) covering all 86 WCAG 2.2 success criteria.
- [`extCheck`](https://github.com/JamalMazrui/extCheck) — checks the accessibility of `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`, and `.md` files, writing per-file CSV reports of issues found by an extensible rule registry.
- [`2htm`](https://github.com/JamalMazrui/2htm) — converts Office documents and other text formats to clean, accessible HTML using Microsoft's own conversion engines, with options for plain text and image stripping.

The three programs share a deliberately consistent interface and a set of friendly features intended to make them equally usable for the typical Windows user (working through a GUI dialog) and for developers automating tasks (working through the command line). Because the same options are available either way, the same scan or conversion can be reproduced from a script or scheduled task exactly as it was performed by hand.

Common features:

- **Fully accessible CLI and GUI**, following platform conventions for accessible interfaces. Every GUI control has a unique mnemonic hotkey; tab order is logical; status, progress, and result messages are announced consistently to screen readers; help text is available in both modes.
- **Equivalent CLI and GUI behavior.** Every option exposed by one mode is exposed by the other, with the same spelling and the same defaults.
- **Familiar across the family.** The three programs use the same control names, dialog layout, and command-line flag spellings wherever the underlying concept is the same. A user who has learned one is immediately at home in the other two — no re-learning.
- **Optional installer for users who prefer a Windows-native install flow.** Each program ships with a small Inno Setup installer (`<program>_setup.exe`) that puts the executable in Program Files, registers a global desktop hotkey (mnemonic to the program name: Alt+Control+X for extCheck, Alt+Control+Shift+U for urlCheck, Alt+Control+U for urlFido, Alt+Control+2 for 2htm), adds a Start Menu entry, and installs the documentation. Users who prefer no installer can run the executable directly from the .zip.
- **Multiple sources in a single command.** A single invocation accepts any number of files, wildcards, folders, URLs, or list files, processed sequentially.
- **Opt-in configuration recall.** When checked, the program remembers the most recent dialog values to a configuration file under `%LOCALAPPDATA%`, so a frequent task is one click away on the next run.
- **Real-time progress in CLI mode; structured summary in GUI mode.** The console shows files and URLs as they are processed, with a short error reason on failure; the GUI message box at the end of the session shows a categorized list of what was completed, failed, or skipped.
- **Force-replacement and skip-existing behavior.** By default, prior outputs are preserved and re-runs skip work already done. A force flag overrides this for a clean re-run.
- **Optional session log.** A diagnostic log can be written next to the program's outputs for after-the-fact review.
